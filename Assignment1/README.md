There are a couple aspects to this site that I found interesting. One is that you can infinitely scroll to the left and right and the content on the page will wrap around to the other side. I also found interesting how different elements on the page are revealed based on how zoomed in you are on the page. https://artsexperiments.withgoogle.com/ocean-of-books?latitude=23.7023&longitude=-155.3644&zoom=1.68
